<h2><b>The problem with absence and existence</b></h2>

<p>The absence of absence exists, but absence doesn't.
"Absence is absent because absence is absent because absence is absent..."</p>
<p>Absence is relative to existence.</p>
<p>Existence implies absence and absence implies existence so existence exists only and only if absence exists</p>
<p>The existence of absence is necessary for existence to exist. "Existence exists because absence exists because existence exists because absence exists..."</p>
<p>But absence doesn't exist.</p>
<p>The existence of existence is absent, but existence isn't.</p>
<p>¿ absence = existence?</p>
