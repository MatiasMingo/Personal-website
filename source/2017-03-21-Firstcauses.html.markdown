<h2><b>Metaphysical first causes</b></h2>

<p>Aristotle defined Metaphysics in two ways. First he said that it is the discipline that studies first causes including the existence of a god also known as the unmoved mover. And secondly as science of <i><b>being qua being</b></i> or being in so far as being.</p>

<p>I remember the first time I comprehended what metaphysics was and the power it had. It was during a philosophy class when I was 16 years old. I don’t recall so well what was the subject my teacher was talking about but I just remember that I asked myself the following question: "For reality to exist it needs to be perceived at first". ¿But what makes perceiving real?". I concluded that for perception to exist it must be perceived by us or by some other entity. I followed the idea by adding that the perception of the perception of reality has to be perceived by us or by another entity. And this loop keeps on going towards infinity. So I realized that for the perception of reality to be possible it must be perceived an infinite amount of times by an infinite perceiver. I got completely fascinated by this idea.</p>

<p>Since then my love for philosophy and especially metaphysics hasn’t subsided. For at least 3 years now I’ve been writing philosophy and I have recompiled a large amount of philosophical ideas, but I never had the chance to share them with anyone. I hope that this website will serve me as a tool to compile and share my philosophical and metaphysical ideas.
