<h2><b>Metaphysical first causes</b></h2>

<p>Aristotle defined Metaphysics as the discipline that studies first causes including the existence of a god or an unmoved mover, and also as science of <i>being qua being</i> or being in so far as being.</p>

<p>I remember the first time i comprehended what metaphysics was and the power it had. It was during a philosophy class when i was 16 years old. I dont recall so well what was the subject my teacher was talking about but i just remember that i asked myself the following question: "For reality to exist it needs to be percieved at first". ¿But what makes percieving real?". I concluded that for percepction to exist it must be percieved by us or by some other entity. I followed the idea by adding that the perception of the perception of reality has to be percieved by us or by another entitie. And this loop keeps on going towards infinity. So i realized that for the perception of reality to be possible it must be percieved an infinite amount of times by an infinite perciever. I got completely fascinated by this idea.</p>

<p>Since then my love for philosophy and especialy metaphysics hasnt subsided. For at least 3 years now ive been writting philosophy and i have recompiled a large amount of philosophical ideas, but i never had the chance to share them with anyone. I hope that this website will serve me as a tool to compile and share my philosophical and metaphysical ideas.</p>
