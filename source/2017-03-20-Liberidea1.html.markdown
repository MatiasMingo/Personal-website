<h2><b>A New Conception of the Economy</b></h2>

<p>I strongly believe that our current economic system has expired and has been expired for at least 10 years. I think that in this day and age we need an economy that adopts the rapidly growing technological advances so that they serve as tools to create and sustain a system that is more efficient, more fare and that includes every singe human being in the benefits this offers. I think we need to digitalize our economy.</p>
